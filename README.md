# Pneumonia Detection Model

This project uses deep learning to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It includes a comprehensive notebook (`pneumonia.ipynb`) for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Deep learning-based image classification.
- Easy-to-follow notebook for training and testing.
- Suitable for educational and research purposes.

## How to Use

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pneumonia-detection.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the notebook and follow the steps:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook pneumonia.ipynb
   ```

## Requirements
